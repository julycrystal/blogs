I am an India based Data Engineer with a bachelors in Computer Science. I am passionate about Data Science and Automation. I am also fascinated with Mathematics and wish to make a career out of it someday. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building data pipelines and automating them at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gr-en/about/consulting-index).

I am always looking to learn new things. I am currently working on a few projects related to Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. At the same time I am actively on the lookout for remote internships which I can pursue in field of Data Science.

I am a strong advocate for open source and I am always interested in working on new projects with new people.
